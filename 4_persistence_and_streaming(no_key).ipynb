        "When building Agents, we’re often working on longer running tasks. This requires understanding of two important concepts: Persistence and Streaming. Persistence lets you record the state of the Agent at a particular point in time. This allows you to go back and resume in that state for future interactions. This is important for long running applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Likewise with streaming, you can emit a list of signals of what’s going on that moment. So, for long running applications, you know exactly what the Agent is doing at that instant. Let us outline the steps followed in the Colab notebook attached with this article:\n",
        "\n",
        "1)\tTo get started, we create the Agent as before.\n",
        "\n",
        "2)\tWe load in the environment variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "3)\tWe make the necessary imports\n",
        "\n",
        "4)\tWe create the Tivily search tool again\n",
        "\n",
        "5)\tWe create the Agent state\n",
        "\n",
        "6)\tWe create the Agent\n",
        "\n",
        "7)\tWe next add in persistence\n",
        "\n",
        "8)\tIn order to deal with persistence, we need to understand the concept of check pointer in LangGraph\n",
        "\n",
        "9)\tA check pointer “check points” the state between every node\n",
        "\n",
        "10)\tTo add in persistence, we use a sqlite server.\n",
        "\n",
        "11)\tThis is a very simple check pointer that uses sqlite under the hood.\n",
        "\n",
        "12)\tWe just use in memory database\n",
        "\n",
        "13)\tIf we refresh the notebook, it will disappear\n",
        "\n",
        "14)\tFor a live use case, you will have to connect it to an external database\n",
        "\n",
        "15)\tWe also have check pointers that use Redis and Postgres and other persistence databases.\n",
        "\n",
        "16)\tHere we initialise the check pointer, we pass it to the graph compile\n",
        "\n",
        "17)\tThis will be another parameter that we add it to the Agent\n",
        "\n",
        "18)\tWe initialize the Agent and pass in the check pointer\n",
        "\n",
        "19)\tWhen we use the Agent, we also add in concept of streaming\n",
        "\n",
        "20)\tThere are two things to care about streaming:\n",
        "\n",
        "a)\tFirst, we take the case of streaming individual messages\n",
        "b)\tNext is the streaming of observation messages that determine the result of taking the action\n",
        "\n",
        "21)\tWe also consider the case if streaming the tokens. For each token of the LLM call, we might want to stream the output.\n",
        "\n",
        "22)\tIn the notebook, we first add streaming to the AI message.\n",
        "\n",
        "23)\tWe create a Human message\n",
        "\n",
        "24)\tWe add the thread config which allows to keep track of different threads and persistence check point\n",
        "\n",
        "25)\tThis allows us to have multiple conversations going on at the same time\n",
        "\n",
        "26)\tThe thread config is mainly a dictionary with config key and a thread id which is a string. Here we set it equal to “1”.\n",
        "\n",
        "27)\tWe call the graph not with the invoke but with stream\n",
        "\n",
        "28)\tWe pass in the messages dictionary as well as the thread config\n",
        "\n",
        "29)\tWe ask a question – What is the weather like in San Francisco?\n",
        "\n",
        "30)\tWe get back a stream of events a) AI Message b) Tool Message c) Thin AI message\n",
        "\n",
        "31)\tWe ask it another question: What about LA?\n",
        "\n",
        "32)\tIt may be oticed that there is no “weather” word here but because of persistence, it does the function call and we can see AI message with stream\n",
        "\n",
        "33)\tWe can call again using he ame thread id, asking: “Which is warmer”?\n",
        "\n",
        "34)\tChanging the thread id, one can notice that the Language Model is not able to retrieve the answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "35)\tThe above snippets covered the importance of persistence and we will next see how we can stream events\n",
        "\n",
        "36)\tLet us now see streaming of tokens\n",
        "\n",
        "37)\tWe use A stream event method that comes on all LangChain and LangGraph Agents\n",
        "\n",
        "38)\tA Sync event is an asynchronous event which means that we use async check pointer\n",
        "\n",
        "39)\tWe import async sqlite server and pass that to the Agent\n",
        "\n",
        "40)\tThis is the same as before – we are just swapping synchronous sql lite server with asynchronous sqlite server\n",
        "\n",
        "41)\tThis allows us to use asynchronous methods on the Graph\n",
        "\n",
        "42)\tWe use a new thread id to start the conversation afresh\n",
        "\n",
        "43)\tWe also use different type of events. The events represent update from the underlying stream. We look for events corresponding to the new token\n",
        "\n",
        "44)\tThese kinds of events are based on model stream\n",
        "\n",
        "45)\tWhen we use these events, we want the event printed out and we print it with pipe delimiter\n",
        "\n",
        "46)\tWhen we run this, we can see the streaming real time\n",
        "\n",
        "47)\tWe will be able to see the streaming of the tokens real time.\n",
        "\n",
        "48)\tThis becomes very useful in production applications.\n",
